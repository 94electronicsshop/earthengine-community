        "Within the last decade, a huge amount of geospatial data, such as satellite data (e.g. land surface temperatures, vegetation) or the output of large scale, even global models (e.g. wind speed, groundwater recharge), have become freely available from multiple national agencies and universities (e.g. NASA, USGS, NOAA, and ESA). These geospatial data are used every day by scientists and engineers of all fields, to predict weather, prevent disasters, secure water supply or study the consequences of climate change. When using these geospatial data, things fast becomes tricky and the following questions arise:\n",
        "\n",
        "– What data is available and where can we find it?\n",
        "– How can we access these data?\n",
        "– How can we manipulate these petabytes of data?\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, an introduction to the Google Earth Engine Python API is presented. After some setups and some exploration of the Earth Engine Data Catalog, we’ll see how to handle geospatial datasets with pandas and make some plots with matplotlib. \n",

        "First, we’ll see how to get the timeseries of a variable on a region of interest. An application of this procedure will be done to extract Land Surface Temperature in an urban and a rural area near the city of Lyon (France) to illustrate the heat island effect. Secondly, we will detail procedures for static mapping and exporting results as a GeoTIFF. \n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the folium library will be introduced to make interactive maps. In this last part, we’ll see how to include some GEE datasets as tile layers of a folium map."
